# Elten2-server
This repository contains the Elten server code used for communication between the client and the database.
Elten is a social network created for blind users.
The client code can be found [here](https://github.com/dawidpieper/elten2).
## This code is obsolete
These interfaces are developed for compatibility reasons only. The Elten server should switch to using the RESTFul JSON API, which is under development.
